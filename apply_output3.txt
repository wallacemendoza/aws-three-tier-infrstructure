Error: Error acquiring the state lock
System.Management.Automation.RemoteException
Error message: Failed to read state file: The state file could not be read:
read terraform.tfstate: The process cannot access the file because another
process has locked a portion of the file.
System.Management.Automation.RemoteException
Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written
by multiple users at the same time. Please resolve the issue above and try
again. For most commands, you can disable locking with the "-lock=false"
flag, but this is not recommended.
